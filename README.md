During my SQL internship, one of the key tasks I worked on was data migration. This involved transferring data from one database system to another while ensuring accuracy, consistency, and data integrity. I used SQL queries to extract data from the source database, transform it as required, and load it into the target system â€” a process commonly known as ETL (Extract, Transform, Load). I also verified that no data was lost or corrupted during the migration. In addition to writing scripts, I checked for duplicate records, mismatched data types, and null values. I collaborated with the development team to understand schema differences and update queries accordingly. This task helped me improve my SQL skills, understand database structures more deeply, and gain practical experience in handling real-world data challenges. Overall, it was a valuable learning opportunity that emphasized precision, planning, and testing in every step of data migration.
